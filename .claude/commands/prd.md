description: Write or update a PRD with the product-manager agent
argument-hint: <feature idea or problem>
---
Run the **product-manager** subagent (or `general-purpose` adopting `.claude/agents/product-manager.md` if the type is not loaded) to write a PRD for: $ARGUMENTS

Relay its report verbatim in Thai, then add one line saying which command would come next (`/adr` for a design question, `/feature <PRD path>` to build it).
